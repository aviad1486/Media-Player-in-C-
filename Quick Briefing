This is my first assignment in C++ at my first degree of Computer Science, i wanted to share it to show my programming skills in C++

Our mission was to implement two types of media player: MP3 and MP4.
There are 3 types of songs: Foxtrot,Techno and Waltz the 3 of them downloaded from SongFactory.
The players are implemented by Linked List and here are the methods of it:
Download:
we're downloading a new song from SongFactory, create a new node and add it to the list.

Play: 
playing the songs will be different between MP3 and MP4:
in MP3 songs are played in a chronological order.
in MP4 songs are played in a reverse order and the player is skiping Techno.

Backup:
In our Main program we're creating 2 instances of player, backup and the media player.
so this method suppose to deep copying our player into backup instance.

Restore:
In this method we restoring all the songs from the backup and deep copying it to the player.

Remove: 
Here we'll delete all the nodes in the list, we have to work delicate here in order to avoid memory leakage.

Requirements for MP3 and MP4:
MP3 initalized with Waltz instance, this song must be played first.
MP4 doesn't play Techno, but when we print the number of songs we should include also the Techno songs.
Main Function:
Creating 2 instances of Player, waiting for input from the user to choose his MP type.
then we let him choose between 5 options with switch case we repeat it by a do-while loop and then deleting our instances
